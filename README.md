# 🚀 GPT-2 Text Generation Project

Welcome to the **GPT-2 Text Generation** project! This project showcases how to use OpenAI’s GPT-2 model to generate creative and coherent text based on a given prompt. Ideal for beginners in NLP and AI, this project provides an accessible way to dive into text generation.

## 🌟 Features

- **User-friendly** prompt-based text generation
- **Customizable** parameters for more control over output
- **Ready-to-run** script for easy deployment

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```plaintext
GPT2-Text-Generation
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt      # Required Python libraries
└── generate_text.py      # Main script for text generation
```
## 📋 Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```plaintext 
git clone https://github.com/amkc777/GPT2-Text-Generation.git
```

```plaintext
cd GPT2-Text-Generation
```
2. Install dependencies:

```plaintext
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
To generate text with GPT-2, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```plaintext
python generate_text.py
```

### Example
For a prompt such as "What is AI?", the script will generate a response that leverages GPT-2's capabilities to give an insightful, creative, or even entertaining answer.

### Customization
You can modify the following parameters in the generate_text.py script for different results:

- max_length: Maximum length of generated text
- do_sample: Enables sampling for more varied output
- num_beams: Number of beams for beam search
- no_repeat_ngram_size: Prevents repeating n-grams for more coherence
- early_stopping: Stops generation upon reaching a satisfactory result

## 💻 Code Overview

Here’s a quick breakdown of the main components in generate_text.py:

- Load Model and Tokenizer: Pre-trained GPT-2 is loaded with transformers.
- Text Generation: The model generates text based on a user-defined prompt.
- Output Decoding: The generated sequence is decoded into human-readable text and printed.

## 📂 Dependencies
Make sure you have the following packages installed:

Transformers: The core library to access pre-trained models
PyTorch: Required for model computation
